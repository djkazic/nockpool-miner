This repo includes code and binaries necessary to participate in [Nockpool](https://nockpool.com), the premier [Nockchain](https://nockchain.org) mining pool, with your Linux or Apple Silicon machines.

### Install

You can download the prebuilt binaries in the release tab. The macOS bins are codesigned and the Linux bins are SLSA3 attested -- we recommend [verifying](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier).


### Run

#### Option 1: Using Account Token (Recommended)
```bash
nockpool-miner --account-token nockacct_youraccounttokenhere --max-threads 12
```

#### Option 2: Using Device Key (Legacy)
```bash
nockpool-miner --key nockpool_yourdevicekeyhere123 --max-threads 12
```

## FAQ

#### How do I get started?

1. Create an account at [nockpool.com](https://nockpool.com)
2. Generate an **account token** in your dashboard (recommended)
3. Use the account token with `--account-token` flag
4. The miner will automatically create and manage device keys for you

#### What's the difference between account tokens and device keys?

- **Account tokens** (`nockacct_*`): Long-lived tokens that can create and manage multiple device keys. One per mining location.
- **Device keys** (`nock_*`): Individual mining tokens created automatically by account tokens. One per mining device.

#### Where do I get tokens?

Create an account at [nockpool.com](https://nockpool.com) and generate account tokens in your dashboard.

#### How many threads should I use?

Logical cores times two minus 4 is a good rule of thumb. E.g., if you have a 16 core Ryzen capable of 32 threads, 28 would be a good target.

#### How much memory do I need?

As much as you can get! Recommended 8GB + 2.5 per thread.

#### How do I use custom jets?

Just swap out the `zkvm-jetpack` dependency in `Cargo.toml`.
